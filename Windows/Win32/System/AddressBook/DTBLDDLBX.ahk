/**
 * DTBLDDLBX describes a drop-down list control that will be used in a dialog box built from a display table.
 * @remarks
 * A **DTBLDDLBX** structure describes a drop-down list control that is displayed as a single item until the user elects to expand it. 
  *   
  * The three properties identified by the property tags work together to display the information in the list and set a related property. The **ulPRTableName** member is a table object that is accessed through a call to [IMAPIProp::OpenProperty](imapiprop-openproperty.md). The table has two columns: one column for the property identified by the **ulPRDisplayProperty** member and the other for the property identified by the **ulPRSetProperty** member. 
  *   
  * The **ulPRDisplayProperty** property drives the list display. When a user selects one of the values from the display, MAPI calls [IMAPIProp::SetProps](imapiprop-setprops.md) to set the corresponding property as identified by the **ulPRSetProperty** member. This means that the property in the same row as the selected display property. The **ulPRSetProperty** member cannot be set to **PR_NULL** ([PidTagNull](pidtagnull-canonical-property.md)).
  *   
  * An initial value is displayed in the list if MAPI has retrieved the property represented by the **ulPRSetProperty** member through a call to [IMAPIProp::GetProps](imapiprop-getprops.md) and located a row in the table with the value for the **ulPRSetProperty** member. The initial displayed value is the contents of the **ulPRDisplayProperty** column from that row that matches the property in the **ulPRDisplayProperty** member of the structure. The value returned by **GetProps** for the property identified by the **ulPRDisplayProperty** member becomes the initial value that is shown when the list is first displayed. 
  *   
  * For an overview of display tables, see [Display Tables](display-tables.md). For information about how to implement a display table, see [Implementing a Display Table](display-table-implementation.md). For information about property types, see [MAPI Property Type Overview](mapi-property-type-overview.md).
