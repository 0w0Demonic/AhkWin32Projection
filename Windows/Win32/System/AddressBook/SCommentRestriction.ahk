/**
 * Describes a comment restriction, which is used to annotate a restriction. Comment restrictions are unlike other restrictions because they are not evaluated.
 * @remarks
 * The **SCommentRestriction** structure associates an object together with a set of named properties. Comment restrictions are unlike other restrictions because they are not evaluated. That is, they are ignored by the [IMAPITable::Restrict](imapitable-restrict.md) method. There is no effect on the rows returned by the [IMAPITable::QueryRows](imapitable-queryrows.md) method after an **IMAPITable::Restrict** call has been made. 
  *   
  * The **SCommentRestriction** structure can be used to keep application-specific information with a restriction when it is saved on disk. For example, a client saving the name of a named property used in a property restriction can do so in an **SCommentRestriction** structure. Saving a property name is not possible in a property restriction because the associated [SPropertyRestriction](spropertyrestriction.md) structure holds only the property tag. 
  *   
  * For more information about the **SCommentRestriction** structure and restrictions in general, see [About Restrictions](about-restrictions.md).
