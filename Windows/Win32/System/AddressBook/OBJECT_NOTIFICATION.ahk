/**
 * Contains information about an object that has undergone a change, such as being copied or modified.
 * @remarks
 * The **OBJECT_NOTIFICATION** structure is one of the members of the union of structures included in the **info** member of the [NOTIFICATION](notification.md) structure. When the **info** member of a **NOTIFICATION** structure contains an **OBJECT_NOTIFICATION** structure, the **ulEventType** member of the **NOTIFICATION** structure is set to one of the following types of events: 
  *   
  * - fnevObjectCreated
  *     
  * - fnevObjectModified
  *     
  * - fnevObjectDeleted
  *     
  * - fnevObjectMoved
  *     
  * - fnevObjectCopied
  *     
  * - fnevSearchComplete
  *     
  * The search complete event, represented by the fnevSearchComplete event type, indicates that the initial search of the domain for one search folder has completed.
  *   
  * The following members that contain information about the original object are used only in move and copy events. 
  *   
  * - **cbOldID**
  *     
  * - **lpOldID**
  *     
  * - **cbOldParentID**
  *     
  * - **lpOldParentID**
  *     
  * These members do not apply to the other types of events.
  *   
  * For more information about notification, see the topics described in the following table.
