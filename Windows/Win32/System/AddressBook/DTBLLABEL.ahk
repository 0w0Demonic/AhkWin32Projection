/**
 * Describes a label that will be used in a dialog box that is built from a display table.
 * @remarks
 * A **DTBLLABEL** structure describes a label control text that is displayed with another type of control to add meaning to that control. For example, most edit controls are positioned next to labels to inform the user of the type of information to be entered. Some controls, such as group boxes and radio buttons, hold their own labels. 
  *   
  * The label can include a Windows accelerator, identified as the character following the ampersand (&amp;). Pressing the accelerator key puts the focus in the first nonlabel, nonbutton control following this label in the display table.
  *   
  * There is no support for multiline labels. Showing multiple lines requires multiple labels.
  *   
  * It is not possible to use a label as a read-only edit control. The difference is that an edit control can be selected and copied whereas a label cannot. 
  *   
  * For an overview of display tables, see [Display Tables](display-tables.md). For information about how to implement a display table, see [Implementing a Display Table](display-table-implementation.md).
