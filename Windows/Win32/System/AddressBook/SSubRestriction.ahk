/**
 * Describes a sub-object restriction which is used to filter the rows of a message's attachment or recipient table.
 * @remarks
 * Sub-object restrictions are not supported by all tables. Typically, only folder contents tables and search results folders support them. For example, sub-object restrictions are used to find a message that has a particular type of attachment or recipient.
  *   
  * If an implementation does not support sub-object restrictions, it returns MAPI_E_TOO_COMPLEX from its [IMAPITable::Restrict](imapitable-restrict.md) or [IMAPITable::FindRow](imapitable-findrow.md) methods.
  *   
  * For a general discussion of how restrictions work, see [About Restrictions](about-restrictions.md).
