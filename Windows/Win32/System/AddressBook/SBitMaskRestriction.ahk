/**
 * Describes a bitmask restriction, which is used to perform a bitwise AND operation and test the result.
 * @remarks
 * The **SBitMaskRestriction** structure performs a bitwise **AND** operation using the bitmask described in the **ulMask** member and the value of the property described by the **ulPropTag** member. If the result is zero, BMR_EQZ is satisfied. If it is nonzero, that is, if the property value has at least one of the same bits set as **ulMask**, then BMR_NEZ is satisfied.
  *   
  * For more information about the **SBitMaskRestriction** structure and restrictions in general, see [About Restrictions](about-restrictions.md).
