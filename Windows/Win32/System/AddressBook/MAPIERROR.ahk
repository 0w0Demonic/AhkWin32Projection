/**
 * Describes the MAPIERROR function and provides syntax, members, additional remarks, and links to additional resources.
 * @remarks
 * The **MAPIERROR** structure is used to describe error information. Clients and service providers pass a pointer to a **MAPIERROR** structure in the _lppMAPIError_ parameter of the [IMAPIProp::GetLastError](imapiprop-getlasterror.md) method. **GetLastError** returns information about the previous error that has occurred to an object. Callers of **GetLastError** free the memory for the **MAPIERROR** structure by calling [MAPIFreeBuffer](mapifreebuffer.md).
  *   
  * The **lpszComponent** member can be used to map the component's Help file, if one exists. Service providers should limit the size of the component string to 30 characters so that it can easily be displayed in a dialog box. The **ulContext** member can also be used to refer to an online Help topic for common errors. 
  *   
  * Because service providers are not required to provide detailed error information, clients should not expect any of the members of the **MAPIERROR** structure that are returned to contain valid data. However, at a minimum MAPI strongly recommends that providers specify information in the **lpszComponent** and **ulContext** members. 
  *   
  * For more information about error handling in MAPI, see [Error Handling](error-handling-in-mapi.md).
