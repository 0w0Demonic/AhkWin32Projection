/**
 * Describes a compare property restriction, which tests two properties using a relational operator.
 * @remarks
 * The comparison order is  _(property tag 1) (relational operator) (property tag 2)_. The properties to be compared must be of the same type. Attempting to compare properties of different types causes MAPI or the service provider to return the error value MAPI_E_TOO_COMPLEX from the [IMAPITable](imapitableiunknown.md) method to which the structure is passed as a parameter. 
  *   
  * The result of a compare property value restriction is undefined when one or both of the properties do not exist. When a client requires well-defined behavior for such a restriction and is not sure whether the property exists, (for example, it is not a required column of a table) it should create an **AND** restriction to join the compare property restriction with an exist restriction. Use an [SExistRestriction](sexistrestriction.md) structure to define the exist restriction and an [SAndRestriction](sandrestriction.md) structure to define the **AND** restriction. 
  *   
  * The properties specified in the **ulPropTag1** and **ulPropTag2** members can be multi-valued if the service provider supports it. 
  *   
  * For more information about the **SComparePropsRestriction** structure and restrictions in general, see [About Restrictions](about-restrictions.md).
