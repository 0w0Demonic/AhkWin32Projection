/**
 * Describes a combo box control that will be used in a dialog box built from a display table.
 * @remarks
 * A **DTBLCOMBOBOX** structure describes a combo box a control that consists of a list and a selection field. The list presents the information from which a user can select, and the selection field displays the current selection. The selection field is an edit control that can also be used to enter text not already in the list.
  *   
  * The two property tag members work together to coordinate the list display with the edit control. When MAPI first displays the combo box, it calls the **OpenProperty** method of the **IMAPIProp** implementation that is associated with the display table to retrieve the table represented by the **ulPRTableName** member. This table has one column a column that contains values for the property represented by the **ulPRPropertyName** member. Therefore, this column must be of the same type as the **ulPRPropertyName** property and both columns must be character strings.
  *   
  * The values for the column are displayed in the list section of the combo box. Therefore, **PR_NULL** ([PidTagNull](pidtagnull-canonical-property.md)) is not a valid property tag for **ulPRPropertyName**. When a user either selects one of the rows or enters new data into the text box, the **ulPRPropertyName** property is set to the selected or entered value.
  *   
  * To display an initial value for the edit control, MAPI calls [IMAPIProp::GetProps](imapiprop-getprops.md) to retrieve the property values for the display table. If one of the retrieved properties matches the property represented by the **ulPRPropertyName** member, its value becomes the initial value.
  *   
  * For an overview of display tables, see [Display Tables](display-tables.md). For information about how to implement a display table, see [Implementing a Display Table](display-table-implementation.md).
