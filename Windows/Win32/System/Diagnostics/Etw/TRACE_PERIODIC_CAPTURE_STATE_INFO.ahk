/**
 * Used with TraceQueryInformation and TraceSetInformation to get or set information relating to a periodic capture state.
 * @remarks
 * Periodic capture state is a way to allow capture state notifications to be
  * routinely sent to providers. When this is enabled, notifications will only be
  * sent to provider registrations that have been previously enabled to the current
  * session. Each provider can define its own response (if any) to a notification.
  * Note that events logged by the provider in response to a notification will be
  * sent to every ETW session that the provider is enabled to, similar to a manually
  * requested capture state.
  * 
  * To use periodic capture state:
  * 
  * 1. Allocate a buffer of type **TRACE_PERIODIC_CAPTURE_STATE_INFO**. The size of
  *    the buffer should be: sizeof(**TRACE_PERIODIC_CAPTURE_STATE_INFO**) + (x \*
  *    sizeof(GUID)), where x is the number of providers you would like to enable.
  * 1. Call
  *    [TraceQueryInformation](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nf-evntrace-tracequeryinformation)
  *    using **TracePeriodicCaptureStateInfo** for the
  *    [TRACE_INFO_CLASS](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/ne-evntrace-trace_query_info_class)
  *    enumeration. Pass the buffer and its size as the _TraceInformation_ and
  *    _InformationLength_ parameters of **TraceQueryInformation**.
  * 1. Set **CaptureStateFrequencyInSeconds** from
  *    **TRACE_PERIODIC_CAPTURE_STATE_INFO** to the minimum frequency supported by
  *    the version of Windows. This value may change in the future, so hard coding
  *    it is not recommended. If the frequency is below the minimum, the call to
  *    [TraceSetInformation](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/nf-evntrace-tracesetinformation)
  *    will fail.
  * 1. Set the **ProviderCount** from **TRACE_PERIODIC_CAPTURE_STATE_INFO** to the
  *    number of provider GUIDs being passed.
  * 1. Add the GUIDs of each provider after the end of the
  *    **TRACE_PERIODIC_CAPTURE_STATE_INFO** structure. This uses the extra space
  *    allocated from (x \* sizeof(GUID)) from the first step.
  * 1. Call **TraceSetInformation** using **TracePeriodicCaptureStateListInfo** from
  *    the
  *    [TRACE_INFO_CLASS](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/ne-evntrace-trace_query_info_class)
  *    enumeration.
  * 1. To turn periodic capture state off, call **TraceSetInformation** again with
  *    **TracePeriodicCaptureStateListInfo** from the
  *    [TRACE_INFO_CLASS](/windows/win32/api/evntrace/ne-evntrace-trace_query_info_class),
  *    NULL for the **TraceInformation**, and 0 as the **InformationLength**.
