/**
 * The WPD\_VIDEO\_SCAN\_TYPES enumeration type describes how the fields in a video file are encoded.
 * @remarks
 * This enumeration is used by the [WPD\_VIDEO\_SCAN\_TYPE](properties-and-attributes.md) property.
  * 
  * There are two types of interleaved file formats that are specified by this enumeration. **WPD\_VIDEO\_SCAN\_TYPE\_FIELD\_INTERLEAVED** refers to a file format where frames are delivered as they were scanned fields alternate and data goes line by line, as shown here:
  * 
  * **Frame 1**
  * 
  * Field 1: Line 1
  * 
  * Field 2: Line 1
  * 
  * Field 1: Line 2
  * 
  * Field 2: Line 2
  * 
  * Field 1: Line 3
  * 
  * Field 2: Line 3
  * 
  * ...
  * 
  * **WPD\_VIDEO\_SCAN\_TYPE\_FIELD\_SINGLE** refers to a file format where each field is stored in a single block of scan lines, and fields are stored sequentially, as shown here:
  * 
  * **Frame 1**
  * 
  * Field 1: Line 1
  * 
  * Field 1: Line 2
  * 
  * Field 1: Line 3
  * 
  * ...
  * 
  * Followed by
  * 
  * Field 2: Line 1
  * 
  * Field 2: Line 2
  * 
  * Field 2: Line 3
  * 
  * ...
