/**
 * MIB_IPMCAST_OIF_STATS_W2K (ipmib.h) stores the statistics that are associated with an outgoing multicast interface.
 * @remarks
 * On the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows ServerÂ 2008and later, the organization of header files has changed. This  structure is defined in the <i>Ipmib.h</i> header file, not in the <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header file. Note that the <i>Ipmib.h</i> header file is automatically included in <i>Iprtrmib.h</i>, which is automatically included in the <i>Iphlpapi.h</i> header file. The  <i>Ipmib.h</i> and <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header files should never be used directly.
