/**
 * The NET_PHYSICAL_LOCATION structure provides NDIS with information about the physical location of a registered network interface.
 * @remarks
 * A network interface provider initializes a 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/ns-ndis-_net_if_information">NET_IF_INFORMATION</a> structure to provide
  *     NDIS with information about each registered interface. The NET_PHYSICAL_LOCATION structure is included in
  *     the 
  *     <b>PhysicalLocation</b> member of the NET_IF_INFORMATION structure.
  * 
  * NET_PHYSICAL_LOCATION contains information that remains constant during the lifetime of the interface.
  *     To register an interface, a provider passes a pointer to a provider-initialized NET_IF_INFORMATION
  *     structure to the 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisifregisterinterface">NdisIfRegisterInterface</a> function.
