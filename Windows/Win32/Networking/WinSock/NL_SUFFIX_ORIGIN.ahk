/**
 * The IP_SUFFIX_ORIGIN enumeration specifies the origin of an IPv4 or IPv6 address suffix, and is used with the IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS structure.
 * @remarks
 * The <b>IP_SUFFIX_ORIGIN</b> enumeration is used in the <b>SuffixOrigin</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/iptypes/ns-iptypes-ip_adapter_unicast_address_lh">IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS</a>  structure.
  * 
  * On the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Vista and later, the organization of header files has changed and the <b>IP_SUFFIX_ORIGIN</b> enumeration is defined in the <i>Nldef.h</i> header file which is automatically included by the <i>Iptypes.h</i> header file. In order to use the <b>IP_SUFFIX_ORIGIN</b> enumeration, the <i>Winsock2.h</i> header file must be included before the <i>Iptypes.h</i> header file.
