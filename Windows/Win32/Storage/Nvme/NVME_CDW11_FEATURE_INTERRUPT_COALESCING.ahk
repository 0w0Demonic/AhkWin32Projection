/**
 * Contains parameters for the Interrupt Coalescing Feature that configures the interrupt coalescing settings.
 * @remarks
 * The controller signals an interrupt when either the Aggregation Time (**TIME**) or the Aggregation Threshold (**THR**) conditions are met. If either the **TIME** or the **THR** fields are cleared to `0h`, then interrupt coalescing is implicitly disabled.
  * 
  * The Interrupt Coalescing Feature is valid when the controller is configured for Pin Based, MSI, Multiple MSI or MSI-X interrupts. There is no requirement for the controller to persist these settings if interrupt modes are changed. It is recommended that the host re-issue this feature after changing interrupt modes.
  * 
  * The controller may delay an interrupt if it detects that interrupts are already being processed for this vector. Specifically, if the [Completion Queue Head Doorbell](ns-nvme-nvme_completion_queue_head_doorbell.md) register is being updated that is associated with a particular interrupt vector, then the controller has a positive indication that completion queue entries are already being processed. In this case, the aggregation time and/or the aggregation threshold may be reset/restarted upon the associated register write. This may result in interrupts being delayed indefinitely in certain workloads where the aggregation time or aggregation threshold are non-zero.
  * 
  * The Interrupt Coalescing Feature applies only to the I/O Submission and I/O Completion Queues. interrupts for commands that complete in error should not be coalesced.
