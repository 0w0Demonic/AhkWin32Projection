 * @remarks
 * In the **NVME_ADMIN_COMMAND_GET_FEATURES** and **NVME_ADMIN_COMMAND_SET_FEATURES** Admin commands, the feature is specified in the Feature Identifier (**FID**) member of the [NVME_CDW10_GET_FEATURES](ns-nvme-nvme_cdw10_get_features.md) and [NVME_CDW10_SET_FEATURES](ns-nvme-nvme_cdw10_set_features.md) structures.
  * 
  * If a Get Features command is received with the Select field **SEL** set to saved and the controller does not support the feature specified by the Feature Identifier being saved or does not currently have any saved values, then the controller treats the Select field as though it was set to default.
