 * @remarks
 * To start executing commands on the controller after a shutdown operation, (when the **SHST** field of the [NVME_CONTROLLER_STATUS](../nvme/ns-nvme-nvme_controller_status.md) structure is set to `10b`, a Controller Reset (setting the **EN** field in [NVME_CONTROLLER_CONFIGURATION](../nvme/ns-nvme-nvme_controller_configuration.md) to `0`) is required. If the host software submits commands to the controller without issuing a reset, the behavior is undefined.
