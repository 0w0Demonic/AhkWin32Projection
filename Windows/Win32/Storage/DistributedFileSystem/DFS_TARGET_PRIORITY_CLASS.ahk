/**
 * The DFS_TARGET_PRIORITY_CLASS enumeration r1 (lmdfs.h) defines the set of possible DFS target priority class settings.
 * @remarks
 * The order of priority classes from highest to lowest is as follows:
  * 
  * <ul>
  * <li><b>DfsGlobalHighPriorityClass</b></li>
  * <li><b>DfsSiteCostHighPriorityClass</b></li>
  * <li><b>DfsSiteCostNormalPriorityClass</b></li>
  * <li><b>DfsSiteCostLowPriorityClass</b></li>
  * <li><b>DfsGlobalLowPriorityClass</b></li>
  * </ul>
  * Server targets are initially grouped into global high priority, normal priority, and low priority classes. The 
  *      normal priority class is then subdivided, based on Active Directory site cost, into site-cost high priority, 
  *      site-cost normal priority, and site-cost low priority classes.
  * 
  * For example, all of the server targets with a site-cost value of 0 are first grouped into site-cost high, 
  *      normal, and low priority classes. Then, all server targets with lower site costs are likewise separated into 
  *      site-cost high, normal, and low priority classes. Thus, a server target with a site-cost value of 0 and a 
  *      site-cost low priority class is still ranked higher than a server target with a site-cost value of 1 and 
  *      site-cost high priority class.
  * 
  * For more information about how server target priority is determined, see 
  *      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dfs/dfs-server-target-prioritization">DFS Server Target Prioritization</a>.
