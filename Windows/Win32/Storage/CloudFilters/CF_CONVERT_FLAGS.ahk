 * The combination **(CF_CONVERT_FLAG_FORCE_CONVERT_TO_CLOUD_FILE | CF_CONVERT_FLAG_DEHYDRATE)** is especially useful in migration scenarios when certain providers are migrating from another platform to cloud files platform and they intend to convert hydrated placeholders on the older platform to dehydrated placeholders on the cloud files platform atomically. Just this flag should be passed for converting full placeholders to cloud files placeholders. If the older platform implements full files as a regular, non-placeholder files, this flag is not needed. Passing this flag on a directory converts directories to cloud files as well, though the **DEHYDRATE** flag doesnâ€™t apply to directories.
 * 
 * Even when the policy **CF_PLACEHOLDER_MANAGEMENT_POLICY_CONVERT_TO_UNRESTRICTED** was specified with [CfRegisterSyncRoot](nf-cfapi-cfregistersyncroot.md), only processes that have registered/connected to the cloud files sync root are allowed to specify this flag.
